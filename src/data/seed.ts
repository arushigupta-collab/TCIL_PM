  aiSummary: [
    "MahaIT is procuring a single System Integrator to rebuild the Aaple Sarkar citizen services portal. Of the 511 services notified under the Maharashtra Right to Public Services Act 2015, 387 are currently available online and 124 remain to be onboarded. The existing 1.0 platform is cited as having a cluttered interface, incomplete digitisation of notified services, no seamless API integration with Gateway Departments, browser compatibility issues, redundant document storage on the Maharashtra State Data Centre, and a limited set of delivery channels.",
    "Aaple Sarkar 2.0 must deliver a unified citizen portal on the MahaSamnavay single sign-on, with onboarding of both Standard and Gateway Departments through a configurable no-code workflow engine, end to end service enablement, and third party integrations including UIDAI, DigiLocker, MahaDBT and a payment gateway. Scope also covers a chatbot, IVR and call centre stack, a Central Project Management Unit function, migration of roughly 1,25,00,000 existing user profiles, and expanded delivery channels including doorstep delivery through the VLE network. Performance targets are demanding: 99.5% portal uptime per calendar month, a minimum of 1,00,000 concurrent users, and API response within 0.30 ms.",
    "Selection is QCBS with a 70:30 technical to commercial weighting, scored as Bn = 0.70·Tn + 0.30·Fn, and a technical bid must reach 70% to qualify for commercial opening. Pre-qualification is heavy: INR 250 Cr average annual turnover on a standalone basis over the three financial years to 31 March 2025, positive net worth across those years, CMMI Level 5 plus ISO 9001, 20000 and 27001, at least 100 IT resources on payroll since 1 April 2022, a 100 seat office in India, and a 20 seat office within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region or an undertaking to open one within 15 days of award. The term is 45 months, nine of implementation and thirty-six of operations, consortiums are not permitted, and the bid is submitted through a four envelope system on MahaTenders.",
